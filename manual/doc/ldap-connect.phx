(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

ldap_connect â€” Connect to an LDAP server

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  ldap_connect ([ string $ldap_uri = NULL ] ) : resource~
Warning

The following signature is still supported for backwards compatibility, but is
considered deprecated and should not be used anymore!

  ldap_connect ([ string $host = NULL [, int $port = 389 ]] ) : resource~

Creates an LDAP link identifier and checks whether the given {host} and {port}
are plausible.

  Note: This function does not open a connection. It checks whether the given
  parameters are plausible and can be used to open a connection as soon as one
  is needed.

===============================================================================
[ Parameters ]

{ldap_uri}

  A full LDAP URI of the form ldap://hostname:port or ldaps://hostname:port for
  SSL encryption.

  You can also provide multiple LDAP-URIs separated by a space as one string

  Note that hostname:port is not a supported LDAP URI as the schema is missing.

{host}

  The hostname to connect to.

{port}

  The port to connect to.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns a positive LDAP link identifier when the provided LDAP URI seems
plausible. It's a syntactic check of the provided parameter but the server(s)
will not be contacted! If the syntactic check fails it returns FALSE. 
ldap_connect() will otherwise return a resource as it does not actually connect
but just initializes the connecting parameters. The actual connect happens with
the next calls to ldap_* funcs, usually with |ldap_bind|.

If no argument is specified then the link identifier of the already opened link
will be returned.
