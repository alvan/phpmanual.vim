*getcwd*

(PHP 4, PHP 5, PHP 7)

getcwd â€” Gets the current working directory

===============================================================================
[ Description ]

  getcwd ( ) : string~

Gets the current working directory.

===============================================================================
[ Return Values ]

Returns the current working directory on success, or FALSE on failure.

On some Unix variants, getcwd() will return FALSE if any one of the parent
directories does not have the readable or search mode set, even if the current
directory does. See |chmod| for more information on modes and permissions.

Caution

If the PHP interpreter has been built with ZTS (Zend Thread Safety) enabled,
the current working directory returned by getcwd() may be different from that
returned by operating system interfaces. External libraries (invoked through
FFI) which depend on the current working directory will be affected.

===============================================================================
[ Examples ]

Example #1 getcwd() example

<?php >

  // current directory
  echo getcwd() . "\n";

  chdir('cvs');

  // current directory
  echo getcwd() . "\n";

<?>

The above example will output something similar to:

/home/didou
/home/didou/cvs
